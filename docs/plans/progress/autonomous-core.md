### 2026-09-28 — plan opened

[ENG-978](https://linear.app/retsu-ai/issue/ENG-978), branch `docs/eng-978-autonomous-core-plan`. Research in
`docs/design/core-autonomy-audit-2026-09-28.md`, a read-only
source audit of `7885f2c` plus the four `.source/` references; no code
changed. Three findings are new and verified from source:

- The 4 MiB per-run context reservation is not re-based by in-run
  compaction (`claim.rs:947–966`; zeroed only at `claim.rs:797` and
  `settlement.rs:502`).
- The 16 MiB model-text counter is per run (`lib.rs:1618`).
- `empty_output_retries` is per run (`lib.rs:1382`).

These are the first failing tests AC0 must reproduce. ADR numbers 0048–0050
were reserved in `root.md`; 0047 is held by the Jev plan (#210).
`mid-run-compaction.md` was deleted. ADR-0039 records its design, and its
open MRC-4 and MRC-5 moved here as AC14 and Goal 5.

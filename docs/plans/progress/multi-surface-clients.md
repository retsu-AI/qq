### 2026-09-10 — plan opened

Plan written from the codebase analysis and the approved direction:
Rust/WASM UI, separately hosted web app, direct private-network
connectivity, Tauri v2 shells, pairing-code enrollment. ADR 0015–0018
reserved in `root.md`; root requests filed for `architecture.md`,
`product.md`, `docs/plans/README.md`, the `wasm32` CI job, and the `rustls`
dependency. Decision #6 (browser credential storage) appended.

Shipped: none. In progress: W1, S1 (same worktree `../qq-msc`). Blocked: none.

#### S1 receipt — 2026-09-10
Commit(s): see branch `feat/multi-surface-clients-plan`.
Tests: 6 added (`qq-protocol` display-name/well-formed, `qq-server` identity in
health/metadata/discovery, foreign-identity metadata retained, reservation
publishes nothing); workspace green, fmt and clippy clean.
Gates: none named.
Deviations: the server identity *is* the store id rather than a second
generated id — one durable identity, already carried by every cursor, so a
client can verify a cursor belongs to a profile with no extra call. Discovery
metadata is now written at `start` (format 2), not at `reserve`, because the
identity is known only after the runtime opens.
Docs: `docs/design/protocol.md` (v17, health, authentication),
`docs/design/architecture.md` (reservation paragraph).
Open: display-name configuration lands with S6; hostname fallback reads
`HOSTNAME`/`COMPUTERNAME`/`HOST` then `/etc/hostname`.

#### W1 receipt — 2026-09-10
Commit(s): see branch `feat/multi-surface-clients-plan`.
Tests: 2 added in `qq-protocol` (`ServerConnection` grammar and redaction);
the 5 decoder/cursor tests moved to a transport-neutral module that compiles
under `wasm-bindgen-test`; workspace green, fmt and clippy clean;
`cargo build -p qq-client --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm`
produces a 410 KiB debug rlib; `--tests` compiles for the target.
Gates: none named.
Deviations: kept one `reqwest` surface for both transports (its wasm backend
is `fetch`) rather than a second HTTP client; timers go through a 30-line
`time` module (Tokio vs `gloo-timers`). The ADR-0017 framework spike is not
part of this slice: W1 proves the client compiles for the browser, the spike
chooses what renders on top of it. `wasm32-unknown-unknown` added to
`rust-toolchain.toml` and a `client-wasm` CI job (root request, done here
because the slice cannot be verified without it).
Docs: `docs/design/architecture.md` (`qq-client` paragraph),
`docs/design/protocol.md` (authentication: `ServerConnection` rules).
Open: browser `EventSource` cannot set `Authorization`/`Last-Event-ID`;
`qq-client` uses `fetch` streaming so this is not blocking, but S3 must
allow those headers in preflight.
